## FlowFieldDemo
Naive implementation of Goal Based Vector Field Path Findig Algoritm, aka Flow Field algoritm

Features:
1. Grid based map partrition
2. Heat map generation, base on Euclidean distance
3. Velocity vector field generation and Local Optima correction
4. Multiple movement behehavior

This demo is inspired by Sidney Durant's article 2013 [Understanding Goal-Based Vector Field Pathfinding](https://code.tutsplus.com/understanding-goal-based-vector-field-pathfinding--gamedev-9007t) ,very good article worth reading.
